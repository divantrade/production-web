# Video Files

## Hero Video
Place your hero video file as `hero.mp4` in this directory.

**Recommended specifications:**
- Format: MP4 (H.264)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Duration: 10-30 seconds (should loop well)
- Size: < 10MB for good loading performance
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 landscape

**Sample video sources:**
- Use any cinematic B-roll footage
- Consider abstract/motion graphics
- Ensure it's suitable for background use (not too distracting)

## Current Fallback
The system will automatically fall back to a sample video from Google's test bucket if the local file is not found.

## Adding Your Video
1. Replace or add `hero.mp4` to this directory
2. Update the poster image at `/public/images/hero-poster.jpg`
3. The video will automatically be used in the hero section
